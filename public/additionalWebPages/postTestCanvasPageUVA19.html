                <p>The Post Test is a great way to see how much you have improved over the course of CONEX. Note this is not the same as a knowledge check that some of you have seen as you reach the end of ALEKS. In fact, to take the post test, you need to go to a brand-new ALEKS course that we've set up just for this purpose.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="post_test_list">Here's what you need to do:<br /><br /></p>
