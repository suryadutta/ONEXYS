				<p><em>We don't want to waste your time this summer!</em></p>
				<p>We want to focus only on the things that will help you the most. So, the diagnostic pre-test is the starting point for QBIT; It does a great job of identifying your strengths and recognizing opportunities for growth.<br /><br /></p>
				<p class="post_test_list">Here's what you need to do:<br /><br /></p>
				<p class="post_test_list post_test_first"><img src="https://conex.herokuapp.com/images/postTest/one_post.svg" alt="one" />Follow the link to the <a href="https://curryvirginia.instructure.com/courses/5814/assignments/45505">Diagnostic Test in ALEKS</a>. This will take you to "QBIT 2020 Diagnostic" course in ALEKS.</p>
				<p class="post_test_list"><img src="https://conex.herokuapp.com/images/postTest/two_post.svg" alt="two" />You will be asked to take an "Initial Knowledge Check." This is the diagnostic. Note that you should not use your notes or any other resources while taking it; there is also no need to prepare for it ahead of time. If a question allows for a calculator, there will be one provided on the screen, but otherwise you should not use any external calculator. Your honest performance on this will benefit you in the long run! When you have finished the pre-test, you will see a score that&ndash;over the course of the next few weeks&ndash;we will work to improve! <strong>Do not</strong> continue on to "Start My Path" at this time&ndash;this is what much of your work in QBIT will center on later this summer!</p>
				<p class="post_test_list"><img src="https://conex.herokuapp.com/images/postTest/three_post.svg" alt="three" />Please complete your diagnostic by <strong>11:59pm CT</strong>, <strong>Thursday, June 18</strong>.</p>
