<div class="coach_name fullwelcome left">Welcome to the Program!</div>
We're excited that you have chosen to be a part of the ONEXYS (Online Experiences for Yale Scholars) community!<br /><br /><strong>ONEXYS is not just about the math.</strong> Sure, you are going to be watching math videos, practicing on adaptive software, and doing some harder applications. But it's more than that.<br /><br /><strong>It's also about connections.</strong> Yup. connections. We want you to talk. And talk some more. And even more! Talk to your coach. Talk to others on your team. You will be part of a team with a coach who will work with you through this experience. So talk! Talk to your coach at least twice a week. You will find that in order to succeed at Yale, you will need to collaborate well. And this is the first step in that process. <br /><br /><strong>It's not about a grade.</strong> There are no grades for this course. Yes, you are going practice and take quizzes. But here's what you will get: feedback in the form of points and badges. Each time you do things helpful to your learning (practice in ALEKS, take an application quiz, complete a reflection), you will earn some points. Completing the Daily Yalies and earning badges earn you more points. Additionally, you will be helping your team ranking as you do these things. <br /><br /><strong>Our ONEXYS coaches rock.</strong> We've hired some amazing coaches this year. They are other undergrads who are a step or two down the road from you. So they know what to do (and not do!) to survive at Yale. Ask them about math. Ask them about the Buttery. Ask them about going to office hours. Ask them about anything you have questions about. You will be getting together with them at least twice a week. We think that you will find your coach will be invaluable in helping you get a head start for Yale.<br /><br />Finish the race. Check out the "Completing ONEXYS" tab to see what we're expecting you to do this summer to finish ONEXYS. We're going to celebrate all of you who finish in September with lots and lots of great food with Dean Marvin Chun and Dean Burgie Howard.</div>

Since we don't give formal grades in ONEXYS, we want to let you know what we expect you to do in order to complete the course. And for those how complete ONEXYS, we're going to have a special dinner in September with Dean Marvin Chun and Dean Burgie Howard recognize what you've done.<br /><br /><strong>Finish Line.</strong> In order to complete ONEXYS, you will need to:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Attempt the pre-Test. You've already done this!</li>
<li>Attempt the post-Test after ONEXYS concludes.</li>
<li>Attempt 100% of all the applications There are 10 total, so you do the math!</li>
<li>Achieve 90% proficiency on the ALEKS Practice.</li>
</ul>
<br /><strong>Progress Bar.</strong> In order to help you cross this finish line, we are providing a progress bar at the top of your home page. Every time you log in, it will show you where you stand in the course.<br /><br /><strong>Team Leaderboard.</strong> Succeeding at Yale requires collaboration. So as a team, you can work together to learn math and do other things that we think will help you at Yale. Every time you do something, you earn points and badges that feed into your team's score.<br /><br /><strong>Badges.</strong> Badges are our way of incentivizing things that we think will contribute to your learning. Each time you log in, you will see your latest earned badges on your home page. But go here to see all possible badges and some hints concerning what you can do to earn these.</div>

<div class="coach_name left">Professor Rolf</div>
<div class="coach_bio">Dr. Rolf, having recently arrived at UVA from Yale, has been dedicated to finding creative, evidence-based ways for students to learn mathematics and to support other educators in this same endeavor. Dr. Rolf has transformed an introductory mathematics course, by taking advantage of online tools and interactive technology to encourage concept engagement and development of problem solving skills. He has created a &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; approach, developing 42 videos and associated preparatory problems that students complete before coming to class. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Dr. Rolf has maintained an active research program. Early in his career, he focused on numerical analysis; his current work is in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Recognized as an authority in technology enhanced education, Dr. Rolf has been invited to lecture at numerous academic institutions and conferences. Most recently, he co-authored Explorations in Complex Analysis, a textbook with accompanying online tools for concept exploration.<br /><br />After earning his Bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Baylor University in Mathematics with a minor in Russian, Dr. Rolf obtained a Master of Divinity degree from Southwestern Seminary. He completed his Ph.D. at Duke University before being appointed as an Assistant Professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1997. There, he received the Commander&rsquo;s Award for Civilian Service for outstanding achievements in faculty development and research performance. In 2000, Dr. Rolf joined the faculty at the United States Air Force Academy, where he initiated and coordinated implementation of technology- based pedagogy into both introductory and advanced mathematics courses. Dr. Rolf and his wife Ann have two children, James and Julia. In addition to thinking about how to help undergraduates learn mathematics, he enjoys cycling, woodworking, and gardening.</div>
