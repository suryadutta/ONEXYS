    <div class="coach_bio">Ramlah Ahmad  is a Mathematics and Economics major and is a rising senior.  She grew up in Brooklyn, NY. At Smith, she is a house treasurer. This year she has spent time doing research in knot theory.  In her free time, she loves to drink chai, haunting the house study, and playing games in the math lounge.  She came to college thinking she would be an engineering major but soon realized that was not her cup of tea.  What she wants to tell new freshman coming in is have an open mind, and there is so much in the world to learn. You might as well learn things you enjoy or will be useful to you.  Lastly, she is so excited to help you all with your ONEXSS journey and perhaps even Smith.
