<div class="coach_bio">My name is Obed Ababio. I am a rising sophomore of Trumbull College, born and raised in Accra Ghana. I attended a large
public Presbyterian high school situated in the capital, Accra, where I focused on a General Science curriculum. My hobbies
include staying indoors to binge-watch TV series, read novels, or entertain my parents with silly jokes and memes, some of which I come up with
myself. Choosing to study at Yale has been my first international experience, and so far, it has been an extremely exciting
one! At Yale, I am an intended electrical engineering with computer science major also interested in economics. I am also actively involved in
the Yale UNICEF club, but during my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer with friends or going for a swim in the practice pool.
I'm looking forward to meeting you all this summer, and I am thrilled to be your ONEXYS coach!</div>

<div class="coach_bio">Hi everyone! My name is Seth Anderson, and I&rsquo;m a rising junior here at Yale. I am a Molecular Biophysics and
Biochemistry (MB&amp;B) major who is also premed/planning to go to medical school post-graduation. I do research at the Yale
Center for Pulmonary, Critical Care &amp; Sleep Medicine where I investigate the role of miRNAs in non-small cell lung cancers. I also work as a
science tour guide and as a peer tutor for the general chemistry sequence. Outside of class and work, I volunteer at HAVEN,
a free clinic for New Haven residents who don&rsquo;t have health insurance, teach English as a second language (ESL) classes to immigrants, and
hold board positions both with the Yale Scientific Magazine&rsquo;s Synapse outreach branch, where I coordinate science
outreach programs for New Haven public school students, and with Yale BeeSpace, the undergraduate beekeeping club. This summer I&rsquo;ll be
staying in New Haven to do research in my lab on a fellowship and also to volunteer with two different clinical studies run
jointly by the Yale and Quinnipiac medical schools. I&rsquo;m originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I went to a small public high school in
a small town outside of the city. It was the worst public high school in my county and one of the worst in the state, and
I&rsquo;m the first student from my high school to attend Yale. If you, like me, feel like you were not adequately prepared by your high school
to study at Yale, you might have worries or anxieties about classes. It&rsquo;s my goal to help alleviate those worries and
to help you come into Yale ready to succeed. I think ONEXYS is a great program to prepare you for your studies. I am excited to be working as a
coach and am looking forward to meeting and preparing my students!</div>

just graduated from Yale, I spent my first two years of college at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, OR before
transferring into Yale at the beginning of my junior year. During my two years at Yale, I was involved in Hangarak, a Korean music acapella
group, was part of the Academic Strategies Program as a Peer Mentor, worked as a tutor for Calculus, and also helped out as part
of the Transfer Orientation Program. My other interests include martial arts, hiking, watching way too much Netflix, and playing with my
dachshund Charlie. Currently, I&rsquo;m back in Oregon taking a year break before returning to school to pursue a Masters in either
Education or Math in my pursuit to become a math teacher. Math has always been my passion, so I&rsquo;m so excited to spend the summer getting
to know you guys and helping you undertake this awesome program!</div>

<div class="coach_bio">Hi, I&rsquo;m Johnny Le, a rising sophomore in JE from Orange County, California. My entire family is from Vietnam, so I
am naturally bilingual. I went to a very large public school; my graduating class had 880 students! Throughout high school,
I didn&rsquo;t do much besides playing a ton of soccer (adult leagues, rec leagues, with competitive club teams, and three years on the varsity
team). As you can guess, I also play soccer here for Yale&rsquo;s C1 Men&rsquo;s team. Beyond that, I am involved with the
Yale Undergraduate Curling Team, Yale Undergraduate Diversified Investments, Yale Net Impact, and have a start-up college consulting business
with my suitemates. I used to play a variety of instruments and am slowly trying to get back into music as a hobby whenever
time allows. My favorite TV shows are Silicon Valley and Rick and Morty, and I enjoy highly-competitive board games. In terms of academics, I
plan to major in Statistics and Data Science and possibly also Economics or Math and Philosophy, but if you know anything
about college students and their majors, that will probably change by the end of this school year. I am super stoked to meet all of you, and I
know we&rsquo;re going to have a blast!</div>

<div class="coach_bio">Hello, I&rsquo;m T.J. Maresca, and I&rsquo;m a rising sophomore in Ezra Stiles College. I grew up just outside Seattle,
WA, and moved to Southern California (right next to Coachella) for high school. I&rsquo;m one of the few pre-vet students
here at Yale, which anyone could figure out based on the amount of time I spend talking about my dogs (Watson and Sweet). As far as
extracurriculars are concerned, my crowning achievement is running the Ezra Stiles Film Festival with my former suitemate. It is open to
students in all residential colleges of all levels of expertise, so feel free to ask me about how to submit a film! I also spend a lot of my
free time writing stories (or videos) and attending the performances of the many musical and dance groups around campus. On the
academics side of things, I will most likely be an Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology (EEB) major, since I love fieldwork and the side of
science that isn&rsquo;t constrained to a microscopic scale. I look forward to being an ONEXYS coach this summer and I hope I can
help make my students&rsquo; transitions to Yale as smooth as possible!</div>
