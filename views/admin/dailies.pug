            p Each day when a student logs into Canvas, a flag on the home page will link to that day's assignment, if there is one. To create a daily assignment, simply follow these steps:

                li
                    p Create the assignment in Canvas like any other assignment, and take note of the assignment ID, which can be found in the URL when editing it.
