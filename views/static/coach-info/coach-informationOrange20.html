    <div class="coach_bio">Hi there! My name is Ashley Ewing, and I am a rising fourth-year at UVA majoring in Neuroscience and minoring in Bioethics. I plan on going to medical school after graduating from UVA. Some extracurricular activities that I am involved in on Grounds are volunteering as an EMT at the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad, research in a Neuroscience lab, leading tours at the Fralin Museum of Art, and leading a small group in a Christian fellowship called Chi Alpha. In my free time, I love to go on hikes! One of my favorite things about Charlottesville is that it is surrounded by many beautiful hiking trails and mountains. I am from Apopka, Florida, so I had never seen mountains before I came to Charlottesville. To this day, the beauty of the mountains continues to amaze me. Lastly, this is my second summer working as a coach with CONEX, and I am so excited to be a part of this team again and to meet all of you!</div>
