	a double major in Biomedical Engineering and Psychology, and will be graduating with the class of 2021. I have been a resident of the International 
	Residential College over the past few years, which has been an amazing experience as I&rsquo;ve met people from all over the world and been able to 
	experience their cultures with them! I play the Bass for the Cavalier Symphony Orchestra, hmu if you're looking for instrumental musical opportunities 
	on Grounds! I&rsquo;m a brother in Theta Tau, the coolest engineering fraternity around. I do research on Hydrogels with Professor Lampe in the Chemical 
	Engineering department (look me up on Google Scholar fam B) ). I'm so excited to get to know each of you and have a great summer together!</div>

	I was born and raised in Northern VA in Centreville, I have two older brothers: both of whom are studying at VCU. I am currently 
	on the pre-med track. I'm also doing research with Dr. Loughran on LGL leukemia at the Loughran Lab. Outside of school, I like to 
	exercise and hang out with friends. I also love to paint in my spare time to help take my mind off of school. One last thing, I 
	love fashion so I started an organization called UVA Thrift that helps people find their own unique style. I am extremely excited
	for CONEX and look forward to working with you!</div>

    <div class="coach_bio">Hello! My name is Ashley Ewing and I am a rising third-year at UVA. I am a Neuroscience major and Bioethics 
	minor on a pre-med track. A main focus of my major is research, and I have found research to be one of my most meaningful learning 
	experiences of college. During my first year, I worked in a Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics lab on RNA-seq. Now I work in a 
	Neuroscience lab in which I perform experiments with Drosophila (AKA flies) to discover biological mechanisms that are relevant to 
	understanding Parkinson’s Disease. When I&rsquo;m not in the lab, I am either volunteering with kids, hanging out with friends, or 
	outside exploring and enjoying nature. I volunteer at the Fralin Museum of Art as a docent, which means that I get to lead tours and 
	talk about art with people of all ages who visit the museum! I also tutor and play games with kids through Madison House&rsquo;s 
	Latinx and Migrant Aid Program. Next year, I will be leading a small group for Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship, which is where I found 
	a good community of friends when I first came to college. Lastly, one interesting fact about me is that I am from Apopka, Florida, so 
	I had never seen snow or mountains before I came to Charlottesville but was very excited to experience these new things. Therefore, 
	I try to learn how to mountain bike, explore trails at O&rsquo;Hill and Humpback Rock, and go to places like Carter&rsquo;s Mountain 
	to see amazing views of Charlottesville with friends. I&rsquo;m so excited to get to know my CONEX team and see all of you find your 
	own interests at the University!</div>

    <div class="coach_bio">Hey bros! I&rsquo;m Ashley, a rising third-year from Ashburn, VA majoring in Biology and Statistics, with a side passion for 
	religious studies. I do a lot of volunteering around grounds, mostly with non-profits that fight food insecurity, homelessness, or provide 
	other crisis intervention services. I&rsquo;m also happily involved in a neuroscience lab (highly recommend my dudes). At this point, you&rsquo;re 
	probably wondering—is she going into research? Or just a masochistic pre-med? To that, my young padawans, I answer: BOTH. I&rsquo;m pre-MD/PhD, so 
	hit me up with your questions about *anything*, from science to doctoring to life advice.
	
	My favorite things in life are my two guinea pigs (lmk if you want pictures of my fluffy potatoes running at warp speed), knitting (I am an old woman 
	at heart, hopefully not in body), and bargain shopping (you don&rsquo;t know true happiness until you buy a gorgeous wooden &ldquo;armoire&rdquo; for $5.99). 
	Excited to meet all you dudes and put the &ldquo;us&rdquo; in calculus! (…they didn’t force me to make that joke…it was all me)</div>

	in JPJ (and seeing Rondo too, I guess), listening to my friends play jazz in Old Cabell, and whupping all my enemies in a snowball fight
