    <div class="coach_bio">Hey peeps! My name is Moronkeji (Keji) Fapohunda, and I am currently a rising fourth-year in the College of Arts of Sciences here at UVA! I'm majoring in Biology and I'm on the pre-med track - being a doctor has been my dream since elementary school!! When I'm not studying for classes, I love to draw, write, sing, and watch anime. My favorite food is Chipotle (which I could eat all day everyday), and I hope to one day create an manga that captivates the world! I'm so excited to work with you this summer, and I can't wait to see you! Cheers! </div>

    <div class="coach_bio">My name is Julian Elmasry. I am the Class of 2020 at the University of Virginia and planned to attend Medical School in the near future. I was fortunate enough to double major during my time  UVA. My first major is Cognitive Science with a concentration in Neuroscience and Linguistics and the second one being Biology. I was born and raised in Galax, VA located in rural, Southwest Virginia. A quick fun fact about myself is I invented a blood test tube that would allow drawn blood samples to withstand warm temperatures longer than currently commonly used blood-collecting test tubes. It's currently patent pending. What I personally like to do for fun is hang out with friends, play basketball, travel, nap, and eat. </div>

    <div class="coach_bio">Hi! My name is Ishita R. Mahajan and I'm a Rising Third Year in the College of Arts and Sciences. I'm Majoring in Biology and Double Minoring in Psychology and Bioethics on the Pre-Med track. I'm particularly passionate about learning how healthcare infrastructure, systems and professionals can better cater towards historically - and contemporarily - medically underserved communities. Right now, a lot of the research and shadowing I've been getting involved with has centered around oncology and holistic cancer management. As per my personal background, although I was born in the U.S., I moved to Korea when I was 3 years old and then Singapore when I was 8 (where I had been living up until becoming a Hoo)! Outside of the school setting, I really enjoy being outdoors, writing, reading and exploring new parts of Charlottesville with friends! I'm super excited and honored to be getting the opportunity to get to know a lot of you :)</div>

    <div class="coach_bio">Hi! My name is Rita Shoukry and I am a rising 4 th year on the pre-med track majoring in biology and minoring in philosophy. I’m from Tarpon Springs, Florida, but I was actually born in Egypt. I began my time as a college student by studying abroad for my very first semester in London, then I arrived at UVA in the spring. While abroad I got to visit some great cities like Paris, Rome, and Palma de Mallorca. I was an intern in the education abroad office at UVA, which allowed me to share my experience with students who were also interested in studying abroad. I am also conducting independent research in the biology department at UVA. In my free time, I love to read and sing, and occasionally enjoy movie nights with my family. One thing I love about UVA is that there are so many different opportunities for students and everyone has a chance to find their place.</div>
