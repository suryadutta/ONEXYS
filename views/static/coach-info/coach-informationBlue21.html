    <div class="coach_bio"> I am Darnisha Augustin, a second-year student at the University of Virginia from West Palm Beach, Florida. I was born and raised in South Florida and decided to make the move to Virginia to attend UVa in person. I intend on majoring in biology on the pre-med track. After my time at the University of Virginia, I hope to be admitted to an accredited Physician Associate program and live out a career as a Physician Associate. A fun fact about me is that I have danced at the halftime shows for both the Miami Dolphins and Miami Heat twice with my competitive cheerleading team. The experience was extremely rewarding and thrilling. It was great to meet some of the players and the cheerleaders as well. I like to do various activities in my free time, but the most interesting activity that I have recently fallen in love with has been jump roping. In the last year, I have taken jump roping more seriously for health reasons and it has turned into an activity that is so enjoyable. I genuinely enjoy learning new tricks with my jump rope. Besides that, I also enjoy listening to music and reading. Those activities help calm me when life gets too hectic.

    <div class="coach_bio">Hi! My name is Rita Shoukry and I just graduated from UVA this past May! I majored in biology and minored in philosophy on the pre-med track. I’m from Hudson, Florida, but I was actually born in Egypt. I began my time as a college student by studying abroad for my very first semester in London, then I arrived at UVA in the spring. While abroad I got to visit some great cities like Paris, Rome, and Palma de Mallorca. I was an intern in the education abroad office at UVA, which allowed me to share my experience with students who were also interested in studying abroad. I was also conducting independent research in the biology department at UVA before the pandemic. In my free time, I love to read and sing, and occasionally enjoy movie nights with my family. One thing I love about UVA is that there are so many different opportunities for students and everyone has a chance to find their place. I can’t wait to meet everyone this summer!</div>
